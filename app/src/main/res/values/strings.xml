    <string name="poem">Acquainted with the Night</string>
    <string name="writer">ROBERT FROST</string>
    <string name="detail">I have been one acquainted with the night.\n
I have walked out in rain—and back in rain.\n
I have outwalked the furthest city light.\n\n

I have looked down the saddest city lane.\n
I have passed by the watchman on his beat\n
And dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.\n\n

I have stood still and stopped the sound of feet\n
When far away an interrupted cry\n
Came over houses from another street,\n\n

But not to call me back or say good-bye;\n
And further still at an unearthly height,\n
One luminary clock against the sky\n\n

Proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right. \n
I have been one acquainted with the night.\n\n\n</string>
